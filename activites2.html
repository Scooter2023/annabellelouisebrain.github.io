	<p> <h3> These are my favorite activities to do each summer and why I like them:
	<ul>
	<li> cooking - food we make is delicous and we get to take home cookbooks </li>
	<li> kayaking - it's a fun time with friends in the lake and the trips are really fun</li>
	<li> dance - we get to do performances at fine arts night and it is really fun</li>
	<li> archery - it is an activity I would never get to do at home, so it is a great opportunity</li>
	<li> swimming- it's so fun to spend time with friends in the lake and play around</li>



	</ul>
